What is the game concept? 
   This game is an interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game between the user and the program.
   
What are the instructions to play?

 In order to play, you must follow the prompts that is given by the computer. Enter your name when it says so, and enter the game mode. There are 3 game modes. Easy, Medium, and Hard. Enter the corresponding number given to you on the prompt, and you will trigger the game mode's function. Then enter your choice of rock, paper, or scissors, and see who wins!
 
What are you most proud of?

 I am really proud of the Hard mode. I tried it myself and it's almost impossible to win against the computer. The easy mode works as well and I'm proud of that too!

What would you do if you had more time?

I would try to see how I could display a User's score after they finish playing the game. Also I wanna figure out what's going on with the medium mode and why it isn't working as intended.
